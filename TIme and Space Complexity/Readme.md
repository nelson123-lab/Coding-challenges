Time and Space Complexitiy of different Sorting Algorthims

Sorting Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space Complexity
----------------- | --------------- | ----------------
Bubble Sort      | O(n^2)          | O(1)
Selection Sort   | O(n^2)          | O(1)
Insertion Sort   | O(n^2)          | O(1)
Merge Sort       | O(n log n)      | O(n)
Quick Sort       | O(n log n)      | O(log n)
Heap Sort        | O(n log n)      | O(1)
Radix Sort       | O(nk)           | O(n+k)
Tim Sort         | O(n log n)      | O(n)

Note: 
- "n" represents the number of elements in the array.
- "k" represents the number of digits in the largest element in the array (for Radix Sort).
- Time complexity is expressed using Big O notation, which represents the worst-case scenario.
- Space complexity refers to the additional space required by the algorithm, excluding the input array.


Search Algorithm | Time Complexity (Worst Case) | Space Complexity
---------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------
Linear Search    | O(n)                          | O(1)
Binary Search    | O(log n)                      | O(1)
Hashing          | O(1)                          | O(n)

Note:
- "n" represents the number of elements in the search space.
- Time complexity is expressed using Big O notation, which represents the worst-case scenario.
- Space complexity refers to the additional space required by the algorithm, excluding the input data.
